# Basic Panel For Flight Simulator

I was very interested in to become a pilot. However, I decided to become a computer engineer. Aviation is still a professional hobby for me. I am a Senior First Officer in Turkish Virtual Airlines. 

As you imagine, you have to handle lots of buttons, valves and keys in a single flight. All of them have keyboard shortcuts. I always wanted to have a home cockpit. This project is a very very very simple one :). I used an Arduino Leonardo and some buttons. Without pressing the keys on keyboard, I used those buttons to open/close some features. Also, I did not use generic Arduino IDE. I used PlatformIO to compile and upload the code to Arduino.

I control things below:

- Landing lights
- Runway turnoff lights
- Taxi light
- Strobe light
- Logo light
- Wing light
- Wheel light
- Auto brake
- Gears
